        <u><h1>The Cursed Prince</h1></u>
        <p>Long ago, a young prince lived in a shining castle. 
            <br>Though he had everything, he was selfish and unkind.
            <br> One winter night, a beggar woman offered him a rose for shelter. 
           <br> He rejected her, and she revealed herself as a beautiful enchantress.
            <br> As punishment, she turned him into a beast and cast a spell on the castle. 
             <br>The rose was enchanted and would bloom until his 21st year. 
             <br>If he could love and be loved in return before the last petal fell, the spell would break.
            <br> If not, he would remain a beast forever. 
            <br>Over time, he lost hopeâ€”who could ever learn to love a beast?
